#  Who are the Pittsburgh Steelers?

The Pittsburgh Steelers are an American football team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The team has won six Super Bowl titles.

The Steelers were founded on July 8, 1933, by Art Rooney, as the Pittsburgh Pirates. The franchise was owned by the Rooney family from 1933 to 1988. The Steelers played their home games at Forbes Field from their founding through 1957. In 1958, they moved to Pitt Stadium and played there through 2000. They moved into their current stadium, Heinz Field, in 2001.

The Steelers were members of the American Football League (AFL) for its entire existence, from 1960 to 1969. They were members of the NFL when the two leagues merged in 1970.

The Steelers have a fierce rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens, and compete annually for the AFC North division title.

#  What is the NFL?

The National Football League, often referred to as the NFL, is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams. The league was founded in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) and merged with the National Football League (NFL) in 1922. The NFL currently operates as a single entity comprising its 32 teams.

The NFL is the largest professional sports league in North America and one of the largest in the world. In terms of revenues, it is the most successful sports league and its championship game, the Super Bowl, is among the most-watched annual sporting events on earth. 

The NFL's regular season lasts seventeen weeks and spans from September to December. Teams play sixteen games over a seventeen-week period. At the conclusion of week seventeen, ten teams make the playoffsâ€”six from each conference; an additional team, designated as a wild card team, enters postseason play if it has won at least half of its games but does not have one of the best two records in its conference. Teams are then seeded according to their performance in these games with Division champions earning home field advantage throughout the playoffs while teams eliminated in earlier rounds are given decreasing levels of seeding priority: wild card weekend winners are first followed by divisional playoff losers, conference semifinal losers, and finally conference champions. 

The playoffs culminate with Super Bowl LIII which will be played on Sunday, February 3, 2019 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. The Los Angeles Rams will play against the New England Patriots for this year's title game.
