#  How much should I expect to spend in Las Vegas? 

If you're looking to have a good time in Las Vegas, you should expect to spend a fair amount of money. While there are certainly ways to enjoy yourself without spending much at all, most people find that they need to budget around $1,000 per trip. This will allow you to see some shows, gamble a bit, and eat out at some of the nicer restaurants. If you're looking to do more extravagant things like take helicopter tours or visit the spa, your costs will go up accordingly.

One of the best ways to save money in Las Vegas is to stay off the Strip. The hotels and casinos there are notoriously expensive, and the food and drink options aren't much better. A better option is to stay in one of the city's many suburbs. There are still plenty of things to do there, and you can often find better deals on hotels and restaurants.

Another way to save money is to avoid drinking alcohol. While it's certainly enjoyable to have a night out on the town with cocktails, it can quickly add up. If you're looking for ways to cut costs, skipping the alcohol is a great place to start.

Ultimately, how much you spend in Las Vegas will depend on what you want to do. But if you're looking for a general idea, plan on budgeting around $1,000 per trip.
