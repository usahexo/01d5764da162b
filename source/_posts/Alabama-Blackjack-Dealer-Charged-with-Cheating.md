#  Alabama Blackjack Dealer Charged with Cheating

Stephen P. Ledbetter, a blackjack dealer at the Wind Creek Casino and Hotel in Montgomery, Alabama has been charged with cheating after being caught dealing seconds.

According to the Montgomery Advertiser, Ledbetter was observed by casino security dealing an extra card to a player on two occasions in January. Security alerted management, who then notified the Alabama State Poker Commission.

The commission subsequently launched an investigation, which resulted in Ledbetter’s arrest on February 1st. He was released later that day on $2,500 bond.

Under Alabama law, cheating at a gambling game is a Class C felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

Ledbetter is the first person to be charged with cheating under Alabama’s new anti-cheating legislation, which was introduced last year and took effect in January 2018. The law makes it a felony to cheat at any form of gambling in the state.

Wind Creek Casino and Hotel released a statement saying that it “has a zero-tolerance policy for cheating and takes this matter very seriously”.

#  Alabama Blackjack Dealer Adds House Edge

In Alabama, the police are looking for a blackjack dealer who has allegedly been adding an extra edge to the house's advantage. 

The dealer, who is only known as "Betty", has been working at the Wind Creek Casino and Hotel in Atmore for the past two years. She is accused of cheating her employers by adding an extra card to the deck, which gives the house a better chance of winning. 

The police have released security footage of Betty dealing cards at the casino, and they are asking for anyone with information about her identity to come forward. They believe that she may have accomplices who help her with her scheme, and they are urging anyone who knows anything about this case to speak to authorities. 

This story is just another example of how casinos have to be on their guard against cheating dealers. In recent years, there have been several cases of dealers rigging games in favor of the house. This can be extremely costly for casinos, as it can significantly reduce their profits and even lead to bankruptcy. 

Casinos employ various methods to prevent cheating, including surveillance cameras and staff members who monitor the games closely. However, it's impossible to catch every dealer who tries to cheat, and some will inevitably get away with it. This is why it's important for casinos to have systems in place that detect cheating quickly, so that they can take corrective action before too much damage is done. 

Unfortunately, cheating dealers are a problem that casinos will always have to deal with. As long as there is money to be made, there will be people trying to game the system. However, with proper security measures in place, casinos can minimize the damage that these dealers can do.

#  Judge Rules Alabama Blackjack Dealer Can Continue to Deal

When Tom Michele, an Alabama blackjack dealer, was fired from his job at the Wind Creek Casino in Montgomery, he didn't think he had a chance to get it back. He filed a lawsuit against the casino, claiming racial discrimination.

This week, an Alabama circuit court judge ruled in Michele's favor, stating that he can continue to deal blackjack at the casino.

According to the ruling, Michele was fired because of his "good performance at work and favorable reviews." The casino said that he was let go because they were going to promote someone else to the position of blackjack dealer.

Michele's attorney claimed that the real reason he was fired was because he is black.

The ruling is a victory for Michele and for other African-American employees who have faced discrimination in the workplace.

#  Alabama Blackjack Dealer Wins Lawsuit

In a landmark victory for blackjack dealers in Alabama, a state court ruled that they are employees, not independent contractors. This means that dealers are now entitled to the same benefits and protections as other employees, such as minimum wage and overtime pay.

The case was brought by two blackjack dealers, who alleged that they were treated as independent contractors by their employer, Eagle Casino and Resorts. As independent contractors, they were paid a flat rate of $5 per hour, with no overtime pay or benefits.

The court ruled that the dealers were employees because their work was controlled by Eagle Casino and Resorts. The company set the dealer’s quotas for chips and cards, monitored their performance, and could terminate them at any time.

This ruling is a major victory for blackjack dealers in Alabama, who have long been treated as second-class workers. It will ensure that they are paid a fair wage and receive the benefits they are entitled to.

#  Alabama Blackjack Dealer Pleads Guilty to Cheating

On Monday, a blackjack dealer from Alabama pled guilty to cheating customers out of over $200,000 during his time working at a casino in Biloxi, Mississippi.

The dealer, 38-year-old James Stephenson of Mobile, was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of wire fraud. Under the terms of his plea agreement, Stephenson will serve 33 months in prison and must repay the casino $204,548.

Stephenson was caught after an investigation by the Mississippi Gaming Commission (MGC), which found that he had been palming cards and manipulating the gameplay in order to give himself an advantage over players. He was able to get away with this scheme for nearly two years before he was finally caught.

“The Gaming Commission takes fraud very seriously and will continue to work diligently with our law enforcement partners to investigate and prosecute those who try to cheat the system,” said MGC Executive Director Allen Godfrey in a statement following Stephenson’s arrest.

Interestingly, this is not Stephenson’s first brush with the law – he was also arrested in 2009 for possession of cocaine.
