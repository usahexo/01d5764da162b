#  How to remove a gambling app from your home screen

Are you feeling the itch to gamble, but don't want to go through the hassle of leaving your house? Well, you're in luck! There's a new gambling app that allows you to place bets right from your home screen. But what happens when you start losing money and can't afford to pay your rent?

Here are four steps to take to remove a gambling app from your home screen:

1. Delete the app

The first step is to delete the app from your phone. This may seem obvious, but it's an important step nonetheless. If you don't delete the app, you're more likely to keep using it, even if you know it's not good for you.

2. Put your phone in airplane mode

If you can't delete the app, put your phone in airplane mode. This will help block notifications from the gambling app and make it harder for you to access.

3. Delete your account or uninstall the app

If deleting the app and putting your phone in airplane mode doesn't work, then delete your account or uninstall the app entirely. This will ensure that you can't use the gambling app anymore.

4. Seek help from a professional

If everything else fails, seek help from a professional. There are many programs out there that can help you overcome a gambling addiction. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.
