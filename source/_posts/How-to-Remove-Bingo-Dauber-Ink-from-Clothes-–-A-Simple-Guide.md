2. Let the stain remover sit for a few minutes, then rinse it off with warm water.

4. Once the stain is gone, wash the clothes as usual.

#  How to Remove Bingo Dauber Ink from Clothing – No Matter the Stain

Even the most careful of crafters can occasionally find themselves with ink on their clothing. This is especially true when using bingo daubers, as these markers are prone to spilling. However, no matter the stain, there are a few methods you can use to remove the ink and have your clothes looking good as new.

The first step is to identify the type of ink that is on your clothing. This is important because different inks require different treatment methods. If you are not sure what type of ink it is, try testing a small area of the fabric with a few different types of solvent. Acetone will work for most types of ink, but if it is not effective then you may need to try something like alcohol or bleach.

Once you have identified the type of ink, you can begin treating the stain. The easiest way to do this is by using a commercial stain remover. These sprays or gels can be found at most stores and work well for removing most types of stains. If you do not have a stain remover handy, you can also try using a homemade cleaner. For this, mix dish soap with water and apply it to the stain. Leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing with cold water.

If the stain is still visible after treating it with a commercial or homemade cleaner, it may be time to consider more drastic measures. One option is to bleach the fabric. However, this should only be used as a last resort as it can often damage the fabric. Another option is to use a hot iron. Place a cloth over the stained area and press down with the iron until the ink has transferred to the cloth.

No matter what method you choose, always be sure to test it on an inconspicuous area of the fabric first in case it causes any damage. With these tips, you should be able to remove any bingo dauber ink from your clothing – no matter how stubborn the stain may be!
