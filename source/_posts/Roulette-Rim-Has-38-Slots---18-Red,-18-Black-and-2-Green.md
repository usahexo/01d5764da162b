#  Roulette Rim Has 38 Slots - 18 Red, 18 Black and 2 Green

The roulette wheel has 38 slots - 18 red, 18 black and 2 green. The green slots are marked with a 0 and the other numbers are coloured in either red or black. The aim of the game is to correctly predict which number will be spun, and if you manage to guess correctly then you'll win back your bet plus a bonus.

Players can place their bets on individual numbers or groups of numbers, and there are a variety of different betting options available. Some players may choose to bet on red or black, while others may bet on a specific number. If you're feeling lucky then you could also choose to bet on whether or not the ball will fall into one of the green slots.

# History of Roulette
Roulette is thought to have originated in France in the 17th century, and the game quickly spread to other European countries. It wasn't until the late 19th century that roulette made its way across the Atlantic and made its debut in America's casinos.

The popularity of roulette continued to grow, and by the early 20th century it had become one of the most popular casino games in the world. Roulette has remained a popular choice amongst casino players ever since, and it's now enjoyed by players from all around the globe.

#  Roulette Rim Offers Chance To Win Twice As Much

A roulette rim is a new game offered at some casinos that allows players to win twice as much as they would ordinarily win on a single spin of the wheel. The rim works by allowing players to place an additional bet on top of their original bet. If the ball lands in a slot on the wheel opposite of the player's chosen number, then the player wins both bets.

The roulette rim is a relatively new game, having been introduced just a few years ago. It has quickly become popular, particularly with those who enjoy playing roulette but are looking for a way to increase their chances of winning. There is no guarantee that the rim will result in a bigger win, but it does offer players the chance to potentially double their money with a single spin.

There are a few things to keep in mind when playing the roulette rim. First, like any other type of bet, there is always the possibility that you could lose your entire stake. Second, not all casinos offer the rim game - so be sure to check before you place any bets. Finally, make sure you understand how the game works before playing - it's simple enough, but there are still some nuances that can affect your odds of winning.

If you're looking for a way to up your game at roulette and potentially increase your winnings, then give the roulette rim a try. It's easy enough to learn and can provide some serious payouts if you're lucky enough to hit on the right number.
