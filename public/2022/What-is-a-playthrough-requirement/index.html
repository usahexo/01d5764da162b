        <h1 id="What-is-a-playthrough-requirement"><a href="#What-is-a-playthrough-requirement" class="headerlink" title="What is a playthrough requirement?"></a>What is a playthrough requirement?</h1><p>In the online casino world, a playthrough requirement is a stipulation that a player must meet before they are allowed to withdraw any winnings they make while playing at the site. Generally, the playthrough requirement is expressed as a multiple of the deposit and bonus amount. For example, if a player has to meet a 25x playthrough requirement, they would have to stake (deposit and bet) 25 times the amount of their deposit and bonus combined before they could cash out any winnings.</p>
<p>While there are some exceptions, most casinos will enforce playthrough requirements on both slots and table games. However, please be aware that blackjack, roulette and other table games often contribute less towards meeting the requirement than slots. For example, if you were to play blackjack at an online casino that has a 25x playthrough requirement and won £100, only £20 of that would count towards clearing the requirement.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that not all games played at online casinos contribute equally towards meeting the playthrough requirement. In most cases, slots will contribute 100% of your wagering towards meeting the required amount; however, other games such as roulette and blackjack usually only contribute between 10% and 20%. This means that if you were to spin the reels on a slot machine for £100 while trying to meet a 25x playthrough requirement, then £100 would be counted towards meeting the requirement. However, if you were to play blackjack for £100 instead, only £10 would be counted towards meeting it!</p>
<p>One way to get around this is by using what’s known as a ‘rollover bonus’. This is where a casino offers you a bonus that’s not tied in with any playthrough requirements – in other words, you can withdraw your winnings as soon as you receive them! However, please be aware that rollover bonuses are few and far between; so if you do come across one, it’s probably best to take advantage of it!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-meet-an-online-casino’s-playthrough-requirement"><a href="#How-to-meet-an-online-casino’s-playthrough-requirement" class="headerlink" title="How to meet an online casino’s playthrough requirement"></a>How to meet an online casino’s playthrough requirement</h1><p>If you’re looking to make a withdrawal from an online casino, you’ll usually need to meet that casino’s playthrough requirement first. This means you’ll need to wager a certain amount of money on their games before you’re able to take any winnings out.</p>
<p>But how much do you need to wager? And what games can you play to help meet the requirement? In this guide, we’ll answer all of those questions and more. So keep reading to find out everything you need to know about meeting an online casino’s playthrough requirement.</p>
<p>How Much Do You Need To Wager?</p>
<p>One thing you’ll need to determine before playing at an online casino is how much you need to wager in order to meet the site’s playthrough requirement. This amount will vary from casino to casino, so it’s important that you check the terms and conditions before signing up.</p>
<p>Generally, the playthrough requirement will be around 30x the amount of your deposit and bonus combined. So if you deposited £100 and received a £100 bonus, you would need to wager £3,000 in total before making a withdrawal. Some casinos may require a higher playthrough amount, while others may be lower. It’s always best to check before depositing any money.</p>
<p>Which Games Can You Play?</p>
<p>Not all games at an online casino contribute towards meeting the playthrough requirement in the same way. Some games offer a 100% contribution rate, while others offer less than that. It’s important that you know which games contribute towards meeting your playthrough requirement so that you can choose wisely when deciding which games to play.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the most common games and their contribution rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slots: 100% contribution rate</li>
<li>Table games: 10-30% contribution rate depending on the game</li>
<li>Video poker: 10% contribution rate</li>
<li>Blackjack: 5% contribution rate</li>
<li>Roulette: 2.5% contribution rate</li>
<li>Craps: 0% contribution rate</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="What-games-can-be-played-to-meet-a-casino’s-playthrough-requirement"><a href="#What-games-can-be-played-to-meet-a-casino’s-playthrough-requirement" class="headerlink" title="What games can be played to meet a casino’s playthrough requirement?"></a>What games can be played to meet a casino’s playthrough requirement?</h1><p>In order to meet the casino’s playthrough requirement and withdraw your bonus and any associated winnings, you’ll need to play games that contribute to the requirement. This varies by casino, but you can usually expect most slots and table games to contribute fully, while video poker, blackjack, and other casino games may only contribute a percentage of the bet.</p>
<p>To get an idea of what games are available for you to play, take a look at the casino’s game lobby or list of games. You should be able to find this information either on the website or in the bonus terms and conditions. If you’re not sure how a specific game contributes, ask customer support.</p>
<p>Once you’ve determined which games to play, it’s important to know how much you can bet without jeopardizing your bonus. In most cases, casinos will have a limit on how much you can bet per round or hand. This information can also be found in the bonus terms and conditions or on the casino website.</p>
<p>If you’re having trouble meeting the playthrough requirement, there are a few things you can do:</p>
<p>-Check if there are any wagering requirements tied to your bonus that must be met before withdrawal. This can include things like betting a certain amount of times on certain games or accumulating a certain amount of points.<br>-Look for smaller bonus amounts that have lower playthrough requirements or no wagering requirements at all.<br>-Play table games rather than slots, as table games typically contribute more towards the requirement.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-consequences-of-not-meeting-a-casino’s-playthrough-requirement"><a href="#What-are-the-consequences-of-not-meeting-a-casino’s-playthrough-requirement" class="headerlink" title="What are the consequences of not meeting a casino’s playthrough requirement?"></a>What are the consequences of not meeting a casino’s playthrough requirement?</h1><p>If you’re like most casino players, you’re probably always on the lookout for new and better deals. After all, who wouldn’t want to get more value for their money? However, it’s important to be aware of the consequences of not meeting a casino’s playthrough requirement.</p>
<p>In general, casinos will require that you meet a certain wagering requirement before they’ll allow you to withdraw your winnings. This means that you’ll need to playthrough a certain amount of your deposit and any winnings before you can cash out. Failure to meet this requirement can lead to all sorts of problems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>forfeiture of your winnings;</li>
<li>confiscation of your deposit; and even</li>
<li>cancellation of your membership.</li>
</ul>
<p>So before you sign up for that great new casino deal, be sure to read the fine print and understand what’s required of you. That way, you’ll know what you’re getting into and won’t be disappointed (or worse) when it’s time to cash out.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-sure-you’re-playing-games-that-count-towards-your-playthrough-requirement"><a href="#How-to-make-sure-you’re-playing-games-that-count-towards-your-playthrough-requirement" class="headerlink" title="How to make sure you’re playing games that count towards your playthrough requirement."></a>How to make sure you’re playing games that count towards your playthrough requirement.</h1><p>In order to ensure that you’re playing the correct games and progressing towards your desired trophy or achievement, there are a few things to consider.</p>
<p>First, make sure you understand the game’s requirements. Check whether the game counts multiplayer or co-operative play towards the total, for example. If it does, then start up an online game with a friend and play through it; this will help rack up progress quickly.</p>
<p>Also check for any miscellaneous tasks that may need undertaking before the game can be considered complete. For example, in Assassin’s Creed III you must collect all of the items in each area before the game can be considered finished. In Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, you need to find all 10 treasures in Chapter 7 - The Grave of Henry Avery. Make a note of any such tasks and work out a plan to complete them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you’re still unsure whether you’ve played the correct game, there are some helpful resources online. One such website is [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">www.gamefaqs.com</a> GameFAQs]. On this website you can search for any given game and view a list of trophies or achievements associated with it; if your goal is to obtain a certain trophy or achievement, then viewing this list will confirm whether or not you’ve played the correct game.</p>
<p> utilising these tips should help ensure that your playthrough requirement is always catered for and that there are no unwanted surprises when attempting to achieve that elusive trophy or 100% completion status!</p>
