</li>
<li><p>set boundaries for yourself. One way to help keep yourself from gambling is to set boundaries for yourself. These boundaries could be anything from financial limits (not spending more than a certain amount on gambling) to time limits (not gambling for more than 2 hours per day). By setting boundaries, you are putting yourself in a position where it will be easier to resist temptation and stay on track with your goals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>develop a healthy lifestyle outside of gambling . Another way to make it easier not to gamble is by developing a healthy lifestyle outside of gambling . This means building interests and activities outside of betting or playing games that revolve around chance . Instead, focus on things that bring you joy and satisfaction without involving money or chance . This could include things like spending time with family and friends, being physically active, enjoying hobbies, etc .</p>
</li>
<li><p>stay positive and motivated along the way . Finally, it’s important to stay positive and motivated throughout your journey towards overcoming gambling addiction . This means being patient with yourself , celebrating small accomplishments along the way , and maintaining Motivation levels high enough so relapse doesn’t become an option .</p>
