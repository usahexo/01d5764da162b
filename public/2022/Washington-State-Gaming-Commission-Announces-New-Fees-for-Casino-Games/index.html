        <h1 id="Washington-State-Gaming-Commission-Announces-New-Fees-for-Casino-Games"><a href="#Washington-State-Gaming-Commission-Announces-New-Fees-for-Casino-Games" class="headerlink" title="Washington State Gaming Commission Announces New Fees for Casino Games"></a>Washington State Gaming Commission Announces New Fees for Casino Games</h1><p>The Washington State Gaming Commission has announced a series of new fees associated with casino gaming. These new fees, which come into effect on July 1st, will apply to all licensed casino operators in the state.</p>
<p>The most significant change is a new “game fee” that will be charged for each game played in a casino. This fee will be assessed at a rate of 2% of the total amount wagered on the game. For example, if a player bets $100 on a game, the operator will be charged $2 for that game.</p>
<p>Other new fees include a $2,000 license fee for each blackjack table, and a $1,000 license fee for each roulette table. In addition, operators will now be required to pay a monthly license fee of $1,000 regardless of the number of games being offered.</p>
<p>Commission officials say that the new fees are necessary to cover the costs of regulating casino gaming in the state. They also note that the fees are significantly lower than those charged by similar agencies in other states.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-State-Casino-Games-to-Get-More-Expensive"><a href="#Washington-State-Casino-Games-to-Get-More-Expensive" class="headerlink" title="Washington State Casino Games to Get More Expensive"></a>Washington State Casino Games to Get More Expensive</h1><p>As of September 1st, 2019, the state of Washington will be implementing a new taxation system on casino games. This means that players can expect to see an increase in the price of games like blackjack, roulette, and craps.</p>
<p>Previously, casino tax rates were based on the house edge of each game. However, this new system will be based on the amount of money wagered instead. This change is expected to bring in an additional $26 million in revenue for the state each year.</p>
<p>While some players may be unhappy with the increase in prices, it’s important to note that this is still a better deal than what other states offer. In Nevada, for example, casino games are taxed at a rate of 10%.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Washington State offers some of the best gambling options in the country. Along with a wide variety of table games, there are also several world-class casinos located in the state. So if you’re looking for a good time and don’t mind spending a bit more money, Washington State is certainly worth considering.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-State-Gambling-Commission-Announces-Changes-to-License-Fees"><a href="#Washington-State-Gambling-Commission-Announces-Changes-to-License-Fees" class="headerlink" title="Washington State Gambling Commission Announces Changes to License Fees"></a>Washington State Gambling Commission Announces Changes to License Fees</h1><p>The Washington State Gambling Commission has announced a change in the fee schedule for licenses issued by the agency. The new fees, which went into effect on July 1, 2018, will increase the cost of some licenses while decreasing the cost of others.</p>
<p>Most notably, the cost of a license to operate a casino has increased from $100,000 to $200,000. The commission justified the increase by noting that it has not raised its licensing fees since 2010.</p>
<p>Other changes include a decrease in the license fee for social-gambling operators from $1,000 to $500, and an increase in the fee for gambling devices from $200 to $400.</p>
<p>The new fees are expected to bring in an additional $1.2 million in revenue annually.</p>
<h1 id="New-Fees-Approved-for-Washington-State-Casino-Games"><a href="#New-Fees-Approved-for-Washington-State-Casino-Games" class="headerlink" title="New Fees Approved for Washington State Casino Games"></a>New Fees Approved for Washington State Casino Games</h1><p>The Washington State Gambling Commission has just approved new fees for casino games, in an attempt to increase state revenue. These new fees will apply to all licensed gambling establishments in the state, including tribal casinos, card rooms, and cruise ships with gaming facilities.</p>
<p>The new fees are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>For slot machines, a flat fee of $150 per machine per year, regardless of the amount wagered.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For all other games, a percentage fee of 5% of the gross wagers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of these new fees is to ensure that all licensed gambling establishments are contributing their fair share to state revenue. According to Commissioner Deborah Batts, “the state’s share of casino gaming revenues has been declining for a number of years, while the overhead costs associated with regulating these businesses have been increasing. These new fees will help us redress that balance.”</p>
<p>Some industry insiders are concerned that the new fees will have a negative impact on business, but Batts is confident that the increase in revenue will more than offset any losses. “If you’re making a profit on your machines,” she says, “you can certainly afford to pay our fee.”</p>
<h1 id="Washington-State-Gaming-Commission-Announces-Revised-License-Fee-Structure"><a href="#Washington-State-Gaming-Commission-Announces-Revised-License-Fee-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Washington State Gaming Commission Announces Revised License Fee Structure"></a>Washington State Gaming Commission Announces Revised License Fee Structure</h1><p>Today, the Washington State Gaming Commission (WSGC) announced a revised license fee structure that will take effect on July 1, 2019. The new fee structure, which is in response to the passage of Initiative 976 last year, will lower the cost of most licenses and reduce the annual fee for a license from $100 to $10.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to announce this revised fee structure, which is designed to make it more affordable for businesses to obtain a gaming license and provide more opportunities for Washingtonians to participate in the gaming industry,” said Commissioner Chris Stearns.</p>
<p>The new fee structure will apply to all types of licenses issued by the WSGC, including casino licenses, card club licenses, and racetrack licenses. Under the new structure, the cost of a casino license will be reduced from $1 million to $500,000, the cost of a card club license will be reduced from $5,000 to $2,500, and the annual fee for a racetrack license will be reduced from $100 to $10.</p>
<p>The WSGC also announced that it plans to create an expedited licensing process for restaurants that wish to offer limited gaming activities such as electronic bingo and pull tabs.</p>
<p>“We want to make it as easy as possible for businesses to get a gaming license and start offering these popular gaming activities,” said Stearns.</p>
