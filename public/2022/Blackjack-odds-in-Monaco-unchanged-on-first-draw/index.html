The €10,000 buy-in tournament, which began on Monday, is the first major event of the year and offers players a chance to win their share of a €200,000 prize pool.</p>
<p>Despite some early jitters on Day 1 of the event, when several high-profile players were knocked out of contention, things eventually settled down and the competition came down to a final table of eight. Belgian pro Dries De Vos was ultimately crowned champion, beating French pro Cyril Andre in a heads-up battle that lasted just two hands.</p>
<p>As usual, there was no change in the odds at the casino on the first draw, with blackjack players still enjoying a house edge of just 0.26%. This compares very favourably to other popular casino games such as roulette (with a house edge of 2.7%), craps (5.3%) and even poker (2.5%).</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some exciting casino action during your stay in Monaco this winter season, be sure to check out the blackjack tables!</p>
<h1 id="Casinos-in-Monaco-still-offering-favorable-blackjack-odds"><a href="#Casinos-in-Monaco-still-offering-favorable-blackjack-odds" class="headerlink" title="Casinos in Monaco still offering favorable blackjack odds"></a>Casinos in Monaco still offering favorable blackjack odds</h1><p>Casinos in Monaco, particularly the newer ones, still offer blackjack players some of the best odds in the world. For example, the Casino de Monte Carlo offers a 3.6% edge to the house on blackjack games.</p>
<p>This is largely due to the fact that Monégasque law forbids casinos from using game rules that give the house an edge over the player of more than 1.5%. In most other jurisdictions, casinos are able to use much more unfavorable rules, which gives them a significant advantage over players.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some favorable blackjack odds while playing in Monaco, head to one of the newer casinos like the Casino de Monte Carlo or the Sun Casino. You won’t be disappointed!</p>

In total, 183 hands were played with a single shuffle and 104 players participated. </p>
<p>Based on this information, it can be inferred that if you are planning a blackjack trip to Monaco in the near future, the odds are basically unchanged from last year. However, it is still always best to consult with a professional casino advisor to get the most accurate and up-to-date advice specific to your situation. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the vast majority of hands – 181 out of 183 – were won by the player with the initial two cards totaling 21. This is known as a “blackjack” and pays out 3:2 on your original bet amount. In total, the house won just 2 hands, meaning that player had an edge of almost 97% in this particular game! </p>
<p>If you are looking for other games with similar good odds, look no further than baccarat. Baccarat offers some of the best odds in all of casino gaming, with a house edge of just 1.06%. So if you’re looking to make some easy money while gambling in Monaco, baccarat should definitely be at the top of your list!</p>
